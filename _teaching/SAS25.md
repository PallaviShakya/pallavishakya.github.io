I was a Teaching Assistant for Climate Change Course (SAS25) in the Winter Quarters of 2022 to 2025. This is an undergraduate course that introduces students to scientific principles of climate change and its societal, political and economic implications. I taught this course both in-person and online.

Having lived in the country with the tallest mountains and the country below sea level, I leveraged my first-hand experiences to help students navigate through the complexities of climate change and explore the possible solutions.  

## Responsibilities

* **Guided discussion sections on topics related to climate change:** My job was to help students think critically on the impacts of climate change by helping them understand its scientific and economic aspects.  I conducted four discussion sections each week over a 10-week quarter.
* **Graded assignments and exams** 
* **Held office hours to help students with their assignments and exams.**
