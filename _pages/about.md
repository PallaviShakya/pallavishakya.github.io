I am a PhD Candidate at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in the Department of Plant Pathology working under the supervision of [Dr. Shahid Siddique](https://nemaplant.org/). I study plant parasitic nematodes: microscopic pests that cause billions of dollars in crop losses every year. Using bioinformatics, genetics and bucket of curiosity, I explore the genomes of these parasitic worms to understand how they interact with the plants and evade plant immunity. 

Before starting my PhD, I received MSc in Plant Biotechnology specializing in Functional Genomics at [Wageningen University](https://www.wur.nl/en.htm). With a strong background in genome and transcriptome analysis, my work has been focused on bridging the gap between bioinformatics (how the data speaks to you) and biology (how can you make sense of the data biologically). 

Outside of academia, I have worked on community-driven projects focused on sustainable agriculture and public health in Nepal. As a part of WASH (Water, Sanitation and Health) and sustainable livelihoods initiative, I worked with local communities to improve their access to clean water, and led workshops with women's cooperatives to promote women's health and hygiene. I also led a team of volunteers to support farmers in building small sustainable businesses through high-value vegetable production in rural Nepal.
