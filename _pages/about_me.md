I am a PhD Candidate at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in the Department of Plant Pathology working under the supervision of [Dr. Shahid Siddique](https://nemaplant.org/). I study plant parasitic nematodes: microscopic pests that cause billions of dollars in crop losses every year. Using **bioinformatics**, **genetics** and **bucket of curiosity**, I explore the genomes of these parasitic worms to understand how they interact with the plants and evade plant immunity. 

Before starting my PhD, I received MSc in Plant Biotechnology specializing in Functional Genomics at [Wageningen University](https://www.wur.nl/en.htm). Interested in my CV? You can find it [here](/files/PallaviShakya_cv_2024.pdf).

## Why am I here?
I aim to bridge the gap between bioinformatics (how the data speaks to you) and biology (how can you make sense of the data biologically). 
Currently, I am expanding my skills in: 
* Genome Assembly and Annotation
* Comparative Genomics
* Building Data Analysis Pipelines
* Deep Learning for Genomics

## I love teaching
As a Teaching Assistant at UC Davis, I have taught undergraduate courses in Climate Change and Animal Biology. Read about my teaching experience [here](/teaching/).

Fun fact: I started my teaching journey as a volunteer teacher in Nepal. I taught Science and English to students on elementary level. 

## Beyond Academia
Outside of academia, I have worked on **community-driven projects** focused on **sustainable agriculture** and **public health** in Nepal. 
* As a part of WASH (Water, Sanitation and Health) and sustainable livelihoods initiative, I worked with local communities to improve their access to clean water, and led workshops with women's cooperatives to promote women's health and hygiene. 
* I also led a team of volunteers to support farmers in building small sustainable businesses through high-value vegetable production in rural Nepal.
