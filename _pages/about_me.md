I am a PhD Candidate at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in the Department of Plant Pathology working under the supervision of [Dr. Shahid Siddique](https://nemaplant.org/). I study plant parasitic nematodes which are microscopic pests that cause billions of dollars in crop losses every year. 

In my work, I blend **bioinformatics**, **genomics** and **molecular biology** to understand how these parasites invade plant roots, manipulate host defenses and survive inside the host plant. 

Before starting my PhD, I received MSc in Plant Biotechnology specializing in Functional Genomics at [Wageningen University](https://www.wur.nl/en.htm). Interested in my CV? You can find it [here](/files/2025_PallaviShakya.pdf).

## What I do and Why
I aim to bridge the gap between bioinformatics (how the data speaks to you) and biology (how can you make sense of the data biologically). I love working with messy genomic data and turning it into clear, biologically meaningul stories about how organisms function. 
My current interests include: 
* Genome Assembly and Annotation
* Comparative Genomics and evolutionary analysis
* Building Reproducible Data Analysis Pipelines
* Deep Learning for Genomics
* Molecular Biology approaches to validate computational findings

## Beyond Academia
Outside of academia, I have worked on **community-driven projects** focused on **sustainable agriculture** and **public health** in Nepal. 
* As a part of WASH (Water, Sanitation and Health) and sustainable livelihoods initiative, I worked with local communities to improve their access to clean water, and led workshops with women's cooperatives to promote women's health and hygiene. 
* I also led a team of volunteers to support farmers in building small sustainable businesses through high-value vegetable production in rural Nepal.
